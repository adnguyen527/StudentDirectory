# StudentDirectory

a database of all the student data collected

The initial data set was built with student data between 6/1 to 7/31. This does not count duplicate mastered topics and only unique topics when it comes to the mastered count. From 8/1/2024 on, all duplicate topics will be consider in the mastered count, but will still keep track of unique topics individually. Ideally, digital workout plan reports should be taken daily for most accurate information. Weekly can be done if you take in account repeated topics throughout the week.
